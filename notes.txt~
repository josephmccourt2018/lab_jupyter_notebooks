461 MEETING NOTES

Get example data from Carlos to play around with plotting and analysis

Jupyter Notebook
- Add code to verify that all checkpoints have been completed
- Make to do list more flexible for different machine types
   1) Input machine name, output correct to do list
      (Don't include ATXG at first since process is different)
      Lower priority: make ATXG to do list
- Working with files from Studio 2 in notebook
  1) save files with default name so as to read in files correctly
- Take away Pro/Manual Control in steps since it will always be Pro Control
- Folder specific to each sample
  - Within folder, have data files (that do not have to be named "sample
  specifically") with standard names
  - Then you can produce data
  - 461 folder on X-ray Lab Server, each student has a folder, and then each
  student has a sub folder with particular sample
  	  - Students can adjust default names to sample specific name
- Have students save files as *.ras instead of *.rasx so that data can be read
in from all SmartLab types (put a note to instruct students to save files
in this manner)
- Add in gereral instructions in "Getting Started in Smartlab" to avoid
repetition of instructions
- Add in general description of what the Jupyter Notebook will do
  - Gathers XRR data from thin film sample
  - Add in diagram of SmartLab geometry and optics (with labels) (GENERAL
  SCHEMATIC, BLOCK DIAGRAM) (include all controllable angles, elements,
  and paramters)
- Add in a note about pre-alignment and optics alignment (will be done before
labs), have them verify all pieces are there
       - perform 2\theta scan and make sure they are zero before sample is
       placed
- Add in Discussion Questions throughout lab
- Simulation of data in Mathematica as well
- Uncertainty in data points





THINGS TO FIX
- to do list step format
- greek letters (have to make sure I am using the correct letters in the different steps)
- add in some basic XRR theory and explanation
- fix analysis code
- list parameters in equation saying what they mean
- add in discussion questions throughout the lab
- get XRR diagram from bedzyk's class notes
  - adjust two interface drawing in XRR description
  - other diagrams for geometry of Smartlab are also in this ppt
- bedzyk will send you text notes for any changes to the language used in
descriptions
- studio II is the only Smartlab with Pro Control
- students will download python (and jupyter) onto their computers
  - create a jupyter notebook explaining how to do this (add to syllabus)
- get picture and diagram for geometry of Smartlab (axes are slightly different,
use \omega not \Omega)
- label figures with numbers and descriptions
- CLEAR DIAGRAM SHOW ALL ANGLES AND X,Y,Z
- add in a "group member name" variable
- add in erf fit for the z scan (approximating the beam size and fitting the
z-scan for more accurate value) (3 parameters, peak intensity, bkgr and full
width half max (2.35 \times sigma))
       - approximating beam as a step function with convolution of Gaussian
       - if the STB fit value looks way off, maybe issues with R_y or R_x
       alignment (rule of thumb: beam width is 25% to 75%), also might be an
       issue with divergence of the beam
       - 1st: approximate with rule of thumb, 2nd do fit
- add in beam_size in important paramters (and maybe other slit sizes)
- add in example XRR scan in "3. Performing XRR" after checklist
- add in step in all cehcklist to transfer data to personal computer
- in Data Analysis: add in a inspection section (find q_c, look at oscillations
(approximate period), approximate slope)
- Add in more comments/clues about why data may look off in reflectivity just
like for z scan
