    "    \n",
    "1. First, let's talk about the **weighted reciprocal lattice**. The weighted reciprocal lattice shows all the allowed reflections for a given orientation of the crytal as black circles with different sizes based on the relative intensity of that given reflection (i.e. weighted). Notice in the top menu bar that the view (or orientation) is set as (001), just as we had set in CrystalMaker. You can select what layer of reflections (i.e. what multiple of (001)) to observe by clicking $\\text{Diffraction}\\to\\text{Set Lattice Layer}$. The reflection at the center of the weighted reciproal lattice are the *specular* reflection for our crystal. All the other reflections are *off-specular* (i.e. $h,k,i\\neq 0$). Note, for Lab 3, we only want to look at off-specular reflections with $l>0$. We will not be looking at the totally in-plane reflections ($l=0$). Hover over any reflection point within the weighted reciprocal lattice to view information about that (hkl) reflection. The displayed information includes the $2\\theta = 2\\theta/\\omega$, elevation $=90-\\chi$, $d$-spacing, $\\phi$, and relative intensity ($\\frac{I}{I_{\\text{max}}}$) of that specific (hkl) reflection. **This is the information you will need for Lab 3.** All films were grown on $\\alpha\\text{Al}_2\\text{O}_3$ so this tutorial will be very useful for your substrate information, but you will also need to repeat this exercise with CrystalMaker and SingleCrystal for your film.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For Lab 3, we want to look at reflections with high relative intensity. The **reflexions list** displayed below the weighted reciprocal lattice lists all the possible reflections. An easy way to find the reflections with the highest intensity is to order the reflexions list by relative intensity. This can be done by clicking on the $\\frac{I}{I_\\text{max}}$ header bar (displayed in blue in **Fig. 6**). For example, the ($\\bar{1}14$) reflection of sapphire has a relaively strong intensity. Find that reflection in the reciprocal lattice by setting the lattice layer to $4$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Now, we will take a look at the **stereogram** (i.e. stereographic projetion) displayed to the right of the weighted reciprocal lattice. Let's the ($\\bar{1}14$) pole to the stereogram to see where it is located. Within the Stereogram menu bar on the right, click the gear icon and select $\\text{New Pole}$ to add the ($\\bar{1}14$) reflection. In addition, we would like to add the family of {$\\bar{1}14$} reflections. This can be done by selecting the pole, clicking the gear icon, and selecting $\\text{Add Symmetry Related Poles}$. Now you will see the family of reflections for {$\\bar{1}14$} within the stereogram window. Go back to the weighted reciprocal lattice and find the other reflections within that family. Hover over those reflections. You should find that the information for the reflections within the family are all the same except for their $\\phi$ value. This is the symmetry we will be looking at in Lab 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You do not have to use the {$\\bar{1}14$} for your experiment, but make sure the reflection you would like to look at has a strong relative intensity so that we can *see* the reflections!\n",
