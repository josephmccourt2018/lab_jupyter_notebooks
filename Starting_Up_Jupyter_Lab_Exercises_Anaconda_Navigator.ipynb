    "# Jupyter Notebook Introduction\n",

    "Jupyter Notebook is a an open source web application/user interface that allows users to create and share documents containing code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text by using a combination of different programming languages. In our Jupyter Notebooks, we will be using **Python 3** for all analysis purposes (in the top right corner of this page, you will see the tag Python 3 which tells you the programming language of the notebook). The most important concept of Jupyter Notebooks is the concept of a **cell block**. Clicking on a block of text or code will highlight (in blue in this case) the current cell block you are viewing. Click on this block of text. In the menu bar at the top of this document, you will see a drop down menu:  <img src=\"https://github.com/josephmccourt2018/lab_jupyter_notebooks/blob/master/images/markdown_dropdown.png?raw=true\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "**Markdown** is referring the type of this cell block. Markdown is a text formatting language supported in Jupyter Notebook. By *double clicking* on the text you are reading right now, you will see the Markdown version of the cell block. You will see the other types of supported cell blocks by clicking the drop down menu. For example, \"Code\" is another type of cell block you will be seeing in this document and they all contain snippets of Python 3 code. \n",
    "\n",
    "To run code of a particular cell block, click into the cell and either click the run button above: \n",

    "<img src=\"https://github.com/josephmccourt2018/lab_jupyter_notebooks/blob/master/images/run_jupyter.png?raw=true\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "or click \"Shift+Enter\" on your keyboard. Running a cell will also allow you to exit the \"code view\" version of a Markdown cell block. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following code cell block contains a line of code that declares a variable $x$ and assigns it with the value of $3$. Run that cell and try changing the value of $x$ to a different value."
